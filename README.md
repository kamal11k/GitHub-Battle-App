# Github Battle App using React

This is a project that I built after taking a training on React-Fundamentals by @Tylermcginnis.If you are curious to learn or 
visit the repo you are welcome. I have committed for all the logical changes I made throughout building the app.You can view 
each commits to know how code are evolved.

* You can clone the repo .My package.json file contains all the dependencies. Just make sure you have node installed in your
